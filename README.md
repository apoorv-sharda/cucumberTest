In this project, I have used Cucumber with Java, Selenium and POM framework.

There are five packages.

One contains the feature file. 
One for all the web elements.
One to read the values from properties file for cross browser compatibility plus to change the url for different tests.
One test runner file that runs the entire project .
One step definitions file that contains all the steps taken.

My goal through while doing this project was to create a project that can be expanded and easy to use. I have used the concept of inheritance,
to extend webelements class into step definitions.

All the dependencies have been added into pom.xml so through git anyone who pulls the project will have the same file.
