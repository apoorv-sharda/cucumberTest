Q.1 How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

=> I spent about two and half hours on the technical test. If it was in real time, I would report the bugs I found such as the name of the restaraunts come in bad response error when you try to filter them on ratings. 

Q.2 What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?

=> As of now Cucumber is very popular because of it's ease of understanding for everyone who can just take a look at features file to get a little knowledge on what's going on. What operations are we working on, and what do we mean to obtain from this tests.

Q.3 How would you implement test automation in a legacy application?

=> To implement test automation for any application we need to figure some points first,
Where is the client currently experiencing the poorest quality?
What are the key areas of functionality (e.g. what makes them money)?
Would the client prefer more features to better quality?
What are the biggest risks to their systems?
If the client could improve one thing what would it be? 
Once we get a knowledge of "if test automation really helps to move forward on the current application" then we move with the basics first. Automating all test cases that could be easier if not done manually. In areas we still are developing. In areas we could do better. I would start from there.

Q.4 How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?

=> In my experience, the website has some glitches. When you try to filter the food by cuisines or sort the restaraunts then the name of the restaraunts come in some error form. Which is a bug and should be removed.
Q.5  Please describe yourself using JSON.
